# We are getting close now..

I am hopefuly for the final release. It is clear to me know I have some desire to reach out to the world. I like to think it isn't just ego. I'd like to do some good for the world. To build something that means something to people.

I suppose it would be easier to just work at a soup kitchen or something. But I feel like there is a grander mission at hand. This isn't something I share often but it means a lot to me. 

I see images like these and they fill my heart with desire to create something, even if it is just an image, that others can take hold of. 

I don't care for an insular life. At least not at the moment. Maybe later.
