I just want to place some images, and then talk about them.

To be done, would be a sketch of how to structure what I am doing.

I don't want to rip of steph completely, but its minimal and by description there isn't much to it.

What's written here is the first attempt to unify all my own masks. The different faces I where in differnet places. An attempt to better understand myself. In many ways I am meek, kind. Through storied I can do anything else. Still what I really am comes through.

<span style="font-size: 12px;">I'd like to thank Claude of course. Their guidance on anything coding.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10px;">I'd like to think that I could I figured this out on my own. With google search that is.</span>

<span style="font-size: 8px;">If you showed me what Claude can do for me today, in 2020, idk I think I would have said it is AGI. Maybe a good google search.
