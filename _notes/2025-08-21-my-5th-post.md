# Was there already a fifth? 

A quick note to jot down.

I will make a quick backlog of these to upload to my actual site.

I feel like there is always so much to do. 1/4 of the work is remember to write down what the work is. I like writing though, I don't feel bad about being lazy, or slow, at least not as much as I would think.

It is more of a.....fear that the time will be filled with something worse. 

<span style="font-size: 8px;">I like these, the grid and the pixle nature of it. I could use this, I like the idea of something boxy, framed, but made to a full image.
